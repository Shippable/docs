# Shippable Server installation guide

Shippable Server comprises of the following -

* Stateless micro services
* Stateful Components - PostgreSQL, Vault (Secret Store) and State store (GitLab server)
* Transient State Components - Redis and RabbitMQ
* Admiral, which is the Shippable Server Installer and Webapp

This document describes the steps to install Shippable Server EE onto two servers.

## Pre-requisites

### OS versions

- Ubuntu 14.04 is required on Server 1 and Server 2.
- Both Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 are supported for Build hosts.

### Open ports

Before we start, you need to open the following ports so that various Shippable Server components can communicate with each other.

#### Server 1
- 22: ssh into the machine
- 5672: amqp
- 15672: amqp admin
- 6379: redis
- 50000: Shippable api
- 50001: Shippable post-login ui
- 50002: Shippable pre-login ui
- 50003: Shippable admin panel
- 443, 5671 and 15671: required to access the message queue admin panel and for build nodes to connect if they belong to a different VPC than the one in which the message queue is provisioned.

#### Server 2

- 22: ssh into the machine
- 80: internal gitlab server api endpoint
- 443: internal gitlab server secure api endpoint
- 2222: internal gitlab server ssh port
- 5432: database
- 8200: vault

### Pre-install packages

You need to install Git and SSH on **Server 1** before downloading and running Admiral, the Shippable Server installer.  Install these by running the following on **Server 1**:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git-core ssh
```

If you are installing on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine and your kernel version is older than 3.19, you will need to update the kernel by running the following commands:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-vivid
$ sudo reboot #restart is required after kernel upgrade
```

## Install Shippable Server

Please have the following information handy before you start the installation:

* IP addresses for **Server 1** and **Server 2**.
* Shippable Server Installer access key
* Shippable Server Installer secret key

**If you do not have an access key and secret ket, please contact us [via email](mailto:support@shippable.com) or through the [Server contact form](https://www.shippable.com/enterprise.html#shippable-server-contact).**

###1. Install Admiral

SSH into **Server 1** and run the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Shippable/admiral.git
$ cd admiral
$ git checkout v5.11.3
```

You will see the following output:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-29-44:~$ git clone https://github.com/Shippable/admiral.git
Cloning into 'admiral'...
remote: Counting objects: 6100, done.

ubuntu@ip-172-31-29-44:~$ cd admiral/
ubuntu@ip-172-31-4-17:~/admiral$ git checkout v5.11.3
HEAD is now at 9018791... updating version.txt to v5.11.3
```

We have checked out tag v5.11.3, which is the latest tag available as of December 2017. To see the complete list of versions and install a specific version, you can run `git tag` to see all the tags and then checkout the tag you want. Please note that versions more recent that 5.11.3 will be available January 2018 onwards and we recommend installing the latest version (which you can find out by running `git tag`).

###2. Run Admiral CLI

Ensure you have the installer access key, secret, and public ip address of the state machine.
Admiral will install the Postgres database in this step and download all images. You will be asked to run
a specific script on **Server 2** during this step to authorize ssh access for **Server 1**.

Run the following command on **Server 1**:

```
$ sudo ./admiral.sh install
```

Follow the steps below:

```

```

You can run `sudo ./admiral.sh info` at any time to retrieve your Login token and Admiral URL.

* Launch the browser and navigate to the specified host and port. Enter the admin token. It might be a good idea to bookmark the Admiral URL.

* The **Installer Access key** and **Installer Secret key** should be pre-populated. Do not change these.

<img src="/images/platform/tutorial/server/admiral-install-1.png" alt="Admiral-2-server">

* Leave the **Admiral environment** and **Database** sections as-is for now.

* For the **Secrets** section, select **New Node**. Enter the IP address of **Server 2**. Copy the command, run it on **Server 2**, and then check the box after you have run the command.

<img src="/images/platform/tutorial/server/admiral-install-2.png" alt="Admiral-2-server">

* For the **Messaging** section, leave the **This Node** selected, and then enter an easy to remember password.

<img src="/images/platform/tutorial/server/admiral-install-3.png" alt="Admiral-2-server">

*  For the **State** section, select **New Node**. Enter an easy-to-remember password and the IP address of **Server 2**. Copy the command, run it on **Server 2**, and then check the box after you have run the command.

<img src="/images/platform/tutorial/server/admiral-install-4.png" alt="Admiral-2-server">

* For **Redis** and **Swarm** sections, leave **This Node** checked.

###4. Configure Source Control Provider(s)

* Click on **Configure & Install**.

* Leave everything in the **Service Addresses** section as is.

* In the **Authorization and Source Control Management (SCM) Providers** section, you need to configure at least one
authorization provider. For instructions on completing this config, choose the provider(s) you want to configure:
    * [GitHub Enterprise](/platform/server/auth-source-control/#github-enterprise)
    * [GitHub](/platform/server/auth-source-control/#github)
    * [Bitbucket Server](/platform/server/auth-source-control/#bitbucket-server)
    * [Bitbucket Cloud](/platform/server/auth-source-control/#bitbucket-cloud)
    * [Gitlab](/platform/server/auth-source-control/#gitlab)

* For now, leave the **Build configuration**, **Email**, **IRC**, and **System Settings** as-is. We will come back to them later.

* Click **Install**.

* After the installation is complete, you will see two buttons. Click **Save** and again click **Save** on the confirmation dialog.

* Click on **Restart services** and click on **Yes** in the confirmation dialog.

Please note that if you make a mistake while entering the fields above and encounter a failure, you should correct the problem , click on **Save**, and then on **Restart services**.

###5. Enabling caching

You can turn on caching by following the steps below:

* Navigate to the **Build configuration** section in the **Configure and Install** panel.
* Select the **Upload artifacts to AWS** option and enter your AWS Access and Secret Keys.
* Click on **Save** and **Restart Services**.

To learn more about the benefits of caching, go [here](/platform/runtime/caching/#caching).

###6. Configure Services

By default, we run one copy of every microservice, which should be sufficient for most installations. You can skip this section and come back to it later if a specific service becomes a bottleneck.

* Click on **Services**.
* Configure the number of replicas (or use the default values) and click **Save**.

###7. Configure add-ons

If you want your users to be able to connect to third party services through [integrations](/platform/integration/overview), you need to configure them in this section.

* Click on **Add-ons**
* Select the account integrations you want to make available to your users.
* Click **Install Add-ons**.

###8. Setup superuser

* You will first need to log in to Shippable Server with your Admin account for the source control provider. To find the Server URL, look in the **Configure and Install->Service Addresses->Shippable UI** section of the Admiral UI:

 <img src="/images/platform/tutorial/server/shippable-server-url.png" alt="Admiral-2-server">

* From the Shippable Server URL, sign in to Shippable Server with your Admin account for the SCM provider, and authorize the application. You will need to click **Authorize** twice.

* You should see your team/organizations/repositories sync and appear under the **Subscriptions** section of the left navbar.

<img src="/images/platform/tutorial/server/shippable-left-navbar.png" alt="Admiral-2-server">

* Click **Profile** in the left sidebar and note down the `Account Id` at the bottom of the screen.
