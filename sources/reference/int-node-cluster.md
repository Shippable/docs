# Node cluster integration

A Node cluster is one or more nodes, to which Shippable could deploy your artifacts.

The nodes (VMs) could be from any cloud provider or self hosted. Shippable interacts with the nodes using IP Address and SSH keys.

##Adding the Account Integration.

You will need to configure this integration to deploy artifacts to a cluster of nodes.

* Click on Integrations in the left sidebar menu followed by the '+' icon in the **Account Integrations** panel.

* Copy the script and run it on all of the nodes.
* Click on **Done**, once the script is executed on all of the nodes.
