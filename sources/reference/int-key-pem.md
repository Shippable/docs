You will need to add this key to both the 'Subscription' Settings **and** the `shippable.yml` of every project you want to use it in.

Example `shippable.yml` integration:
```
integrations:
  key:
    - integrationName: MyPEMKeyIntegration
      type: pem-key
```
 * `integrationName` is the name of the PEM integration you added to the 'Subscription' settings.
 * `type` is pem-key

Your PEM key will be available on your build minion in the `/tmp/ssh/` directory, and can be used in your `shippable.yml`.

##Editing your PEM Keys

Click on **Integrations** in the left sidebar menu and then click on your integration. You can then change integration name and pem key.
