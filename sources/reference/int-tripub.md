# Joyent Triton integration

Shippable lets you easily deploy your Dockerized applications to popular Container Services like Joyent Triton Public Cloud.

You will first need to configure an account integration with your credentials and/or keys in order to interact with these services using Shippable Pipelines.

To actually use it for CI or Pipelines, you will also need to add this integration to the Subscription that contains your CI or Pipelines.

Follow the steps below to create an account integration with Joyent Triton Public Cloud.

## Adding Joyent Triton integration

- Click on Integrations in the left sidebar menu followed by the '+' icon in the **Account Integrations** panel.
