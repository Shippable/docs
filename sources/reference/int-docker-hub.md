# Docker Hub integration

The Docker Hub integration is required if you want to configure any of the following scenarios:

- Pull a private image, e.g. [to use as custom image](../ci/custom-docker-image/) to spin up your CI container
- Build a Docker image which has a `FROM` that pulls a private image
- [Push an image](../ci/push-docker-hub/)
- Use an image from Docker Hub as a [resource](resource-image/) as part of your DevOps pipeline

This page explains how you can add a Docker Hub integration to your account so that we can authenticate against it when working with images stored there. The actual `yml` configuration is covered in the relevant docs sections.

##Adding your Docker Hub integration

- Click on Integrations in the left sidebar menu followed by the '+' icon in the **Account Integrations** panel.
