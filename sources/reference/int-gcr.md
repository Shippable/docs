# GCR integration

An GCR integration lets you configure the following scenarios:

- Pull a private image for your CI workflow
- Build a Docker image which has a `FROM` that pulls a private image
- Push an image as part of CI
- Use an [image resource](resource-image/) as part of your CD pipeline.

##Adding the Account Integration

1. Click on Integrations in the left sidebar menu followed by the '+' icon in the **Account Integrations** panel.

3. Choose **GCR** from the list of integration types.
4. For **Integration Name** use a distinctive name that's easy to associate to the integration and recall. Example: **gcr_integration**
5. Enter your JSON key that you have create on Google Developer Console. For more on JSON keys and Service accounts, read <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/auth#using_a_json_key_file target="_blank"> Google's docs</a>.
6. Assign this integration to the Subscription(s) you want to use it in. Since you're likely a member of many organizations, you need to specify which of them can use this integration.
