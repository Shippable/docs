# Hipchat integration

You can send HipChat notifications for any status changes for CI and monitored Docker images.

To send these notifications to HipChat channel(s), you will first need to add an integration to your Account Integrations.

##Adding a HipChat integration

There are two actions to set up the HipChat integration through the UI. They are:

- Generate a token for API access
- Add the Hipchat integration to your subscription

###Generate a token for API access

1. Sign in to your HipChat account using [this link to generate a token](https://www.hipchat.com/account/api).
     - Provide credentials to your HipChat account, if prompted.
2. Create a token with `Send Message` and `Send Notification` scopes.
