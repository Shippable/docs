# Installing from AWS Marketplace

Shippable Server - Startup Edition (SE) is available on AWS Marketplace and can be installed by going
through a one-click purchase and install process. This will bring up Shippable Server on an EC2
instance of desired configuration. Once launched, you will configure the installation
to connect your third party services (like your source control system) using the Admin panel.

## Purchase process
When purchasing Shippable Server SE from the AWS Marketplace, you'll make the
purchase via your AWS account using the payment method associated with your account. All
Shippable Server SE purchases made through the AWS Marketplace come with a 30-day free trial
and have the option for hourly or annual billing, with annual billing provided at a
discount.

You will be notified by AWS prior to completion of your 30-day free trial with the option to
cancel your purchase prior to completing the trial period.

If annual billing selected, you will be notified by AWS prior to your annual term
expiring with the option to extend for another annual term. If you choose not to renew, upon
completing the annual term, billing will automatically convert to hourly billing.

## Admin panel

Shippable Server Admin panel can be accessed from a local browser using
http-over-ssh. This ensures that the admin panel is only available to the users
who have ssh permissions for the server.

### Steps to access Admin panel
- If the IP address of the server is `1.2.3.4`, then run the following command
  on your local system to access admin panel.
```
$ ssh -L 50003:1.2.3.4:50003 -C ubuntu@1.2.3.4
```
- This will establish a secure tunnel between the local system and Shippable
  Server
- To access the admin page, navigate to `http://localhost:50003` on your
  browser.
  - This should prompt for a login token
  - The login token is the EC2 instance ID of the server. This can be fetched
    from the AWS EC2 instances panel

## Configuration

- After successfully logging in, you must create passwords for
  `Messaging` and `State`. These should be more than 8 characters to be valid.

- The `Installer Access Key` and `Installer Secret Key` fields can be left
  blank.

- Once passwords are set, click `Initialize`. This will prep the system with
  core dependencies like database, message queue, secrets store, docker etc.

- After initialization is complete, navigate to the next section `Configure and
  Install` to set up authentication provider(s).

- In the `Authorization and Source Control Management (SCM) Providers`,
  section, select the SCM provider of choice. We'll configure Github as
  a provider as an example.
  - Check the box for `Github`, `Auth` column
  - On `https://github.com/settings/developers` register a new application
  - The callback URL should be `http://1.2.3.4:50001/auth/github`
  - Save and copy the keys for this application into Github auth section of
    Shippable admin panel

- In the `Service Addresses` change the `API` IP address to the public IP
  of server. The port should remain the same. For our example, the value will
  be `http://1.2.3.4:50000`

- In the `Service Addresses` change the `WWW` IP address to the public IP
  of server. The port should remain the same. For our example, the value will
  be `http://1.2.3.4:50001`

- Click `Install`. This should set up Shippable services and bring up the UI.
  Once complete, you should be able to navigate to `http://1.2.3.4:50001` and
  log into Shippable using a Github account.
