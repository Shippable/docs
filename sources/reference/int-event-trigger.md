# Event Trigger integration
Shippable supports triggers on user-specified webhook URLs or other enabled projects.
By default, configured triggers are hit only if a commit build succeeds.

This page explains how you can add a Event Trigger integration to your
account by providing the Project name or Webhook URL and the Authorization.

##Adding an Event Trigger integration
You can add the integration for a Project or for a Generic Webhook.

###Adding the Account Integration for a Project
- Click on Integrations in the left sidebar menu followed by the '+' icon in the **Event Trigger** panel.

- Choose **Event Trigger** from the list of integration types.
-  Name your integration..
-  Under 'What would you like to trigger?' select `Project` from the dropdown choices.
-  [Optional] Select the Project that you want to associate the integration.
-  In the 'Authorization' field, you'll need to specify the Shippable API Token.
-  Assign this integration to the Subscription(s) you want to use it in. Since you're likely a member of many organizations, you need to specify which of them can use this integration.
-  Click on `Save`.
