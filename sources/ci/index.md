###### What is Shippable?

Shippable was founded so that software powered organizations could accelerate innovation. We enable this by providing an integrated platform, built from the ground up, to defragment and streamline the process of shipping applications. Using Shippable, you can automate your software delivery from source control to production, without needing to write complex, imperative code.

Today, most organizations find it challenging to innovate fast enough to satisfy consumers. DevOps is a set of principles that tries to solve this problem. One of these principles is automation of your software delivery pipelines, also called Continuous Deployment.

The picture below shows a high level maturity model for Continuous Deployment.
